Use this as a template. Keep the headers and remove all other text. In all, your report can be quite short. When it is complete, render and then push changes to your team repository.

```{r}

## Abstract

Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that describes the contents of your write-up.

## Dataset

Write a brief data description, including: how data were obtained; sample characteristics; variables measured; and data preprocessing. This can be largely based on the source paper and should not exceed 1-2 paragraphs.

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

Summarize your findings here. I've included some subheaders in a way that seems natural to me; you can structure this section however you like.

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

Tasks 1-2

### Methodlogical variations

Task 3

### Improved classifier

Task 4
